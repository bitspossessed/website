# How we work

<div class="container-medium">

  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb">
    Within bitspossessed we want to promote our values by working transparently in terms of organizational structure and contribute to "open source" structures to
    inspire other collectives.
  </div>

  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb">
    <p>We as collective members are all freelancers and we have both individual and collective projects.</p>
    <p>Our projects can be for external clients, collaborations or internally initiated projects. Sometimes they are financed by the client themselves and sometimes through grants.</p>
    <p>We like to use our internal resources to support the projects and communities that are aligned with our values.</p>
    <p>As a team we can join efforts with other teams or be hired as a complete team by an external client. It can be the whole collective or only some members.</p>
    <p>Within the collective we share our connections and networks to find suitable projects for us to work on. We also support each other in our individual freelancer work. Being a freelancer can be lonely and tough. Therefore we engage in moral support, skill-sharing and professional advice in our different areas of expertise.</p>
    <p>To develop our skills we also learn together through study circles on different topics and individual learning sessions.</p>
    <p>We believe that our approach to work allows us to collaborate more effectively which benefits both our clients and the world beyond.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know more about our internal structure you are welcome to get in contact! We especially want to support other collectives and cooperatives who share similar values.</p>
