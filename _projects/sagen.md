    <br>In the South of Sweden there is a newly bought communal house for cultural project and workspaces. <br> Sågen is a local community and cultural hub in rural southern Sweden. There is a cooperative that owns an old factory where members have their own businesses, workshops and cultural events. The place has been rented since 2019 but was bought in April 2024 through a crowd funding and crowd lending campaign. <br> Starting in 2024 there is also a non-profit local cinema in the building! <br> Bitspossessed members have helped in the development of the crowd lending website for Sågen and also the general website for the cinema Bio Sågen. <br> <a href="https://bio.sagensvenskop.se/" target="_blank">Cinema Bio Sagen</a>
