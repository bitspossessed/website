  <p>
      Edycs Epilepsy Group is the leading voluntary, non-governmental organisation in Mauritius, founded on 24 December 1997 by a group of volunteers, patients, and health professionals. Its mission is to assist people with epilepsy through advocacy for access to quality health care, provision of free medication, diagnostic support, training in epilepsy care, and campaigning for changes in attitudes and behaviors.
      As Bitspossessed, we developed a database system for registering patients, tracking medications and service history, as well as generating reports.
