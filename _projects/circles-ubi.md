  We are the maintainers of Circles UBI, a protocol and open source project running a basic income on the Ethereum blockchain. Since we
  launched the project in 2020, Circles has become a wider network of collectives and initiatives building alternative economic systems for their local
  neighborhoods. The initial work has mostly been carried by the Bitspossessed developer collective and the Circles Cooperative in Berlin. If you are interested
  in more information about Circles and its philosophy, you can read our official <a href="https://joincircles.net/faq/" target="_blank">FAQ</a> and the <a
