  <h2>Expected behaviour</h2>

We expect members and collaborators of the bitspossessed collective to remain mindful of, and take responsibility for, their speech and behavior. This includes:

- Acting out of respect for others.
- Actively listening to others and not dominating discussions.
- Respecting physical and emotional boundaries.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert moderators if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of
this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

  <h2>Unacceptable behaviour</h2>

We do not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

  <ul>
    <li>Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, or deliberate intimidation.</li>
    <li>Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate or unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact (sexual or otherwise).</li>
    <li>Unwanted photography or recording.</li>
    <li>Disclosure of a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not consent to disclose
    other identifying information.</li>
    <li>Inappropriate or unwanted publication of private communication. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying information for the
    purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) and/or in the case of whistleblowing, is acceptable.</li>
    <li>Harming the discussion or community with methods such as sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration (i.e. trolling).</li>
    <li>Discrimination, particularly against marginalized and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.</li>

  <h2>Scope</h2>

We expect all community participants (members, contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community
venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

This code of conduct and its related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has
the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb">
  <h2>Reporting</h2>

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please contact our moderator as soon as possible via email at
<a href = "mailto: counsellor@bitspossessed.org">counsellor@bitspossessed.org</a> which is monitored by the Spaceship Councellor, a rotative role for
<a href="https://bitspossessed.org/" target="_blank">bitspossessed</a> collective members.

Moderator(s) will follow <a href="https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Responding_to_reports" target="_blank">internal guidelines</a>
for enforcing our Code of Conduct. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to
the circumstances. Moderators are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Additionally, our moderator(s) are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable
behavior feel safe.
