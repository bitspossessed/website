# Mission and Vision

<div class="container-medium">
  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb ">
    We are bitspossessed, a software developers collective. We support people, organizations, and communities to realize technologically-driven ideas.<br><br>
    bitspossessed provides a healthy, supportive space for our members to build software cooperatively. We strive to contribute to a more just and equitable tech industry, a sustainable digital commons, and an ecologically-regenerative future that prioritizes care and social responsibility.

  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb">
    We are especially interested to work on projects that involve some or all of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Activism</li>
      <li>Art</li>
      <li>Political perspectives</li>
      <li>Community-focused technology</li>
      <li>p2p and mesh-networks</li>
      <li>Open source</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-item grid-item-mb">
    <p>We as collective members are all freelancers and we have both individual and collective projects.</p>
    <p>Our projects can be for external clients, collaborations or internally initiated projects. Sometimes they are financed by the client themselves and sometimes through grants.</p>
    <p>We like to use our internal resources to support the projects and communities that are aligned with our values.</p>
    <p>As a team we can join efforts with other teams or be hired as a complete team by an external client. It can be the whole collective or only some members.</p>
    <p>Within the collective we share our connections and networks to find suitable projects for us to work on. We also support each other in our individual freelancer work. Being a freelancer can be lonely and tough. Therefore we engage in moral support, skill-sharing and professional advice in our different areas of expertise.</p>
    <p>To develop our skills we also learn together through study circles on different topics and individual learning sessions.</p>
    <p>We believe that our approach to work allows us to collaborate more effectively which benefits both our clients and the world beyond.</p>
    <p>If you would like to know more about our internal structure you are welcome to get in contact! We especially want to support other collectives and cooperatives who share similar values.</p>
